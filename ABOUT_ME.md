Hey I'm Kacper!
I'm front-end / mobile developer focusing on react / react-native technologies and laverage them to create cross-platform apps. I'm highly intrested in trying new programming languages (especially those set in functional paradigm) and applying different mindsets to my code.

I'm consultant and mentor. I love sharing my knowledge with others and introduce them to the world of programming. I participated in lots of boot camps trainings and keep doing that!

I also have a degree in Automatics and Control System Engineering, but implementing User Interfaces definitely took my heart.
