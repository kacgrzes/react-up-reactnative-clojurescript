## What feels good

- syntax
- community
- language rules

## What feels wrong

- not many wrappers for libraries, so you need to write it by your own
- we can use js libs in clojurescript code, but that looks strange. It just feels bad to use interop
- default indentation, but there is [clojure-style-guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide) and [parinfer](https://shaunlebron.github.io/parinfer/) to solve the issue
